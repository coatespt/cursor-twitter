I jotted down the main categories we talked about last night in no particular order.  I probably missed some.

Unemployment and its consequences. Some people say obviously socialism is inevitable because only an elect 
few will be able to have jobs.  Others feel that's not so clear--we could just slide into a world of the 
ultra rich and a vast sea of starving peons. Or we could have a world where people have enough, and spend 
their days hanging out with friends and relatives, doing interesting things. 

People and cultures losing their way because of a loss of understanding of ourselves. Artificial intelligence
so far seems to be just a bag of relatively simple tricks. Will people lose touch with their humanity as they
begin to see themselves as just a bag of tricks? It was once clear that thoughts and awareness were in one
person's head, and were communicated to other heads via language, writing, images, etc. But now, that essential
human-ness seems to be slipping into the ether. Where is the boudary of self now?

A bifucation of the population into the tiny subset who are driven to use AI to sharpen their undersanding 
of the world and the mass of people who get dumber and dumber as they let AI do all their thinking for them.
This doesn't seem like something in the future--we seem well into it now.

Truly effective AI, i.e., AI's as smart as a college grad, would be so powerful that why would the company that
has them want to sell it?  It's such an amazing edge over the competition.  Analogy to the most powerful hedge 
funds--they don't sell their expertise as a service, they use it themselve. 

The power it puts into the hands of anybody. AI is an example of a broader phenomenon. Already, anybody with 
a college level understanding of genetics and a very little money can manufactor viruses in their basement.  
God knows what mischief peope could do with AGI.
