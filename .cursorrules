# Cursor Rules for Twitter Data Processing Pipeline

## Project Structure
- This is a Go-based Twitter data processing pipeline with Python components
- Main project directory: `cursor-twitter/`
- All source code should be in `src/` directory
- Configuration files belong in `config/` directory
- Logs should be written to `logs/` directory (not `src/logs/`)

## Configuration Management
- **CRITICAL**: There must be only ONE authoritative config file: `config/config.yaml`
- Do NOT create multiple config files in different locations
- Do NOT create backup config files with different names
- All code must reference the single config file at `config/config.yaml`
- The `log_dir` field is REQUIRED in the config file - no defaults allowed

## Code Organization
- Go source files go in `src/` directory
- Python scripts go in `sender/` directory
- Parser components go in `parser/` directory
- Keep the project structure clean and organized

## Logging
- Logs must be written to the directory specified in `config.yaml` `log_dir` field
- Never hardcode log paths in source code
- The program should fail if `log_dir` is not specified in config
- Do not create log directories automatically - they must exist

## Git and Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Keep the repository clean and organized
- Update documentation when making significant changes

## Development Guidelines
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Follow Go and Python best practices
- Document any new configuration options
- Keep the codebase maintainable and well-documented
