# Cursor Principles

Paste this into Cursor when starting a new chat.

Before doing anything that changes code, please ask me any questions you have about this before you begin.

Never, under any circumstances do any git operation for any reason until we have explicitly discussed the operation you contemplate. Assume you misunderstood me.

Don't run the program yourself without asking. The program runs forever and I have to kill it to get your attention back. I will handle running the program.

If you are going to make changes that you cannot reliably rewind without getting further input from me, warn me so that I can commit everything in a working state.

Do not implement anything without explicit approval. Sometimes I just want to talk about an approach. Asking a question or soliciting your opinion doesn't mean that I want to rewrite the codebase!

For every feature, we need to add unit tests.  The tests should be carefully commented about what is being tested and why the pass/fail conditions are what they are.

For any significant code change, we must run the test suite!

When a test doesn't pass, we have to look at why before changing anything. No removing tests because they don't pass unless we agree the test is obsolete.

If any changes seem to involve multiple threads, be sure to get my agreement before doing anything. Anytime there thread safety constructs like mutex, etc., always check. We keep getting into trouble with unnecessary and incorrect thread complexity.
